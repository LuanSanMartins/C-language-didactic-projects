# Didactic-projects-in-Language-C

This repositories there are the projects that I developed during the C programming language course at UNICAMP. There are more of sixty projects involving functions condictions (if/else, switch/case, and ternary operator), functions of repetition (while, do while, and for), several types variables (int, float, and char), and the librarys "stdio.h" and "string.h".
So, there are projects about Fibonacci Sequence, algorithm of Bubble Sort, algorithm that identifies primes numbers, that identifies pair numbers, or odd numbers, that identifies vowel, consonantes, and algorithm that identifies palindrome too. Also, there are very much other algorithms about other cases.
